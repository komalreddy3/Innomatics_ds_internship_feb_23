"""
Given an integer array nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. You can return the answer in any order.

You must write an algorithm that runs in linear runtime complexity and uses only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
Explanation:  [5, 3] is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,0]
Output: [-1,0]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: [1,0]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
Each integer in nums will appear twice, only two integers will appear once.

    '''
        say nums = [1,2,1,3,2,5]
        x = XOR(nums) -> 6
        Binary form of 6 is 110

        find the first set bit position and divide the array into 2 based on that bit position
        why?
            Becoz 6 is the result obtained after 3^5 -> if we can throw these numbers into different parts 
            then our smaller arrays looks like -> [find the number that will appear exactly once and 
            remaining elements appear twice]

        Based on 2nd bit position if we partition the array it looks like

        Array1 -> [1,1,5]
        Array2 -> [2,3,2]

        Apply XOR for each part -> TADA!!!! We got what we want
